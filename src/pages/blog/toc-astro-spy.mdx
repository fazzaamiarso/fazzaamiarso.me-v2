Sometimes, there is a table of content to help us navigate through a blog more easily. When building a custom blog with remark and rehype, a standard solution is to use the `rehype-toc` plugin. 

In Astro, we can build a table of content without extra plugins. Astro already provides us with the necessary property by default. As an extra touch, we will add a scroll spy to keep track of our current heading.

<Notes>
I use the Astro [blog starter template](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/blog) as a starting point.

## Create the Component
Let's create a new Astro component called `TOC.astro` and define the needed props. 

<MetaCodeBlock filename="/components/TOC.astro">
```astro
---
export type Props = {
    pageHeadings : Array<{depth:number,text: string; slug: string }>
}

const { pageHeadings } = Astro.props;
---
<aside id="#toc">
    <ul>{pageHeadings.map(h => {
        return <li> <a href={`#${h.slug}`}>{h.text}</a></li>
    })}</ul>
</aside>

```
</MetaCodeBlock>

The `pageHeadings` props will be special [`headings`](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/layouts/#markdown-layout-props) props passed from the astro layout component. Astro automatically assigns an id to all headings in markdown, which become slug in `headings` props.


```ts
[{
    text : "Implement TOC",
    depth : 1,
    slug: "implement-toc"
},
{
    text : "Create Markup",
    depth : 2,
    slug: "create-markup"
}]
```

Insert the TOC into the blog layout and pass it to the special `headings` props

<MetaCodeBlock filename="/layout/BlogLayout.astro">
```astro
---
const {headings} = Astro.props;
---
<body>
    <Header />
        <main>
            <article>
            <h1>{content.title}<h1>
            <hr />
            <slot />
            <TOC pageHeadings={headings} />
            </article>
        </main>
    <Footer />
</body>
```
</MetaCodeBlock>

Let's add a little style to the TOC, so it's fixed to the right.

<MetaCodeBlock filename="/components/TOC.astro">
```astro
<style>
    #toc {
        position: fixed;
        top: 0;
        right: 5rem;
    }
    ul {
        list-style: none;
    }
    a {
        text-decoration: none;
    }
</style>
```
</MetaCodeBlock>

Here's the result.

<CldImage publicId="toc-initial" alt="table of content initial markup" width="500px" />

The TOC is working and sufficient for most use cases. But, we will enhance it with a scroll spy to highlight the active heading.

## Scroll Spy with Intersection Observer
We must let the TOC know which heading is intersecting by observing/spying on the heading with Intersection Observer.

### Add an Observer Callback Function
Firstly, insert a script tag in the TOC file. Afterward, create the observer callback function responsible for detecting and setting the active state.

<MetaCodeBlock filename="/components/TOC.astro">
```astro
<script>
const setCurrentHeading : IntersectionObserverCallback = (entries) => {
    // loop to each entries (headings) in the page
    for (let entry of entries) {
    // equivalent to the slug returned from pageHeadings
    const { id } = entry.target;
    // get the TOC link's element for the current entry
    const tocLinkEl = document.querySelector(`#toc a[href='#${id}']`);
    if(!tocLinkEl) return;
    }
}
</script>
```
</MetaCodeBlock>

The above code loops through each entry and selects the link element. It also has a guard in case the link element doesn't exist, which is unlikely.

Then, add the active styling to the intersecting entry.

<MetaCodeBlock filename="/components/TOC.astro">
```ts
// check if the entry is intersecting
if (entry.isIntersecting) {
// remove active class from all links
document.querySelectorAll("#toc a").forEach((e) => e.classList.remove("active"));
// add active class to the currently active entry
tocLinkEl.classList.add("active");
}
```
</MetaCodeBlock>


Here's the active class for this example.
```css
a.active {
    color: red;
    font-weight: 600;
}
```

### Observer Option
Let's define the option for the observer.

<MetaCodeBlock filename="/components/TOC.astro">
```ts
const observerOptions = {
    threshold: 1,
    rootMargin : "0px 0px -66%"
}
```
</MetaCodeBlock>

Here's the explanation for the option.
- `threshold: 1`  means we want to register the element as an entry when the element is fully visible.
- `rootMargin: "0px 0px -66%"` means we crop the observer's viewport height by 66% at the bottom. So, our viewport have 33% of it's height. It's helpful because we want the entry to be active only when a user has scrolled enough past the heading.

### Observe the Headings
We have all the pieces needed to create an observer instance to observe the headings.

<MetaCodeBlock filename="/components/TOC.astro">
```ts
const observer = new IntersectionObserver(setCurrentHeading, observerOptions);
// select all headings to observe
const elToObserve = document.querySelectorAll("article :is(h2,h3)")
// finally, observe the elements
elToObserve.forEach(el => observer.observe(el))
```
</MetaCodeBlock>

What the code does is select all headings that we want to observe. Then, loop through each heading and observe them by calling `observe()`.

Here's the final result.

<CldImage publicId="toc-demo" alt="table of content demo" width="500px" type="gif" />

You can also see how I implement it [in my blog](https://github.com/fazzaamiarso/fazzaamiarso.me-v2/blob/main/src/components/mdx/TOC.astro) with TailwindCSS and `sticky` positioning.
